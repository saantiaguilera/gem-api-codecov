# Codecov

This gem is for running codecov from a ruby script.

If you were using bash, you would do a simple curl redirect into a shell (`bash <(curl -s http://some.bash.script.com)`). But this cant be done from ruby since the redirect isnt available.

This gem is here for providing exactly that behavior.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'codecov'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install codecov

## Usage

### Import

Require the module:
```ruby
require 'codecov'
```

### Setting destination of the script

Use the provided setter
```ruby
Codecov.set_script_destination "somewhere/over/the/rainbow/file.sh"
```

_Note_: The module will only download the file once, so that the overhead of the api is as low as possible

### Running

For running simply invoke
```ruby
Codecov.run
```
And thats it! It will be as running `bash <(https://www.codecov.io/bash)`

#### Arguments

If you wish to pass arguments to the bash script, pass them as a map of either `nil`, `String` or `Array`.

Eg.
```ruby
params = {
  'c' => nil,
  'X' => [ 'glib', 'silent', 'test' ],
  't' => 'access_token',
  'root_dir' => '',
  's' => nil,
  'f' => [ 'file1.txt', 'file2.txt' ]
}
Codecov.run params
```
Will be: `bash <(https://www.codecov.io/bash) -c -X glib -X silent -X test -t access_token -root_dir '' -s -f file1.txt -f file2.txt`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
